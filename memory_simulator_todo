check.sv cache for design details

we are going to use vpi instead of system verilog
vpi actualy works

everything gonna need more thought
the cache adds a new problem
we need to minimize the functions being called on clk rise
and the memory request needs to be able to feed cache
and cache needs to be able to feed memory controller.
going to rely heavily on queues and some policy

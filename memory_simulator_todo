dont spend too much time on this project at one time
this project is long term, never going to be done 
as there will always be new things to add and improvements

also it is important we learn to make time for things and balance
things out and parallize work

important to be able to start working on something if u have a free hour
that way u can make time for things we want to do

instead of whining we dont have enof time for things, we make it by using 
those hours we end up having free
============================================================

we are going to use vpi instead of system verilog
vpi actualy works

everything gonna need more thought
the cache adds a new problem
we need to minimize the functions being called on clk rise
and the memory request needs to be able to feed cache
and cache needs to be able to feed memory controller.
going to rely heavily on queues and some policy

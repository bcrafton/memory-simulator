i do not think cache line number shud be in cache line object

change things from time to current_time

we have to flush things out of the cache...
    means we need to make a policy.

need things to update the cache and flush out memory...
i guess the update function can sort of do this

a write miss and a read miss cannot both make read requests same cycle

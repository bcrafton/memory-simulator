change things from time to current_time

we have to flush things out of the cache...
    means we need to make a policy.

need things to update the cache and flush out memory...
i guess the update function can sort of do this

a write miss and a read miss cannot both make read requests same cycle

- think we figured out the LRU policy and mem read returns and cache update thing.

we need a set to figure out if a mem rd requst has already been made.
    and not double issue these.

i do not think cache line number shud be in cache line object
need to sort out what a cache line is
what it should contain and possible wrap it differently.

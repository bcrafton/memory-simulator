call heirarchy

cache read and write requests are both super easy
that interface is already complete.

update function and init functions are necessary unfortunately
wish we cud make clk cycle 1/2 unit time only think in 1s

we are calling the return functions every cycle...
i gess there are some things that are better suited to an update function tho
update shud be called first at the start of each cycle however...

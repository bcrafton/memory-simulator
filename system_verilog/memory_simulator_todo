this is the todo file for this project

currently we are adding a cache and a memory controller object to wrap everything up

not sure if we want to use 1 object for memory requests
or if the cache and ram can use the same one

ram is 16 bit wide, 1024 (2^10 addressing) deep
the cache will be 16 byte 8 slot = 128 byte

so that means cache is 1/10 size of the ram
which is fine

it will also be direct mapped
